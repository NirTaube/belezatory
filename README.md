Hey there!

This mini project involves working with data from an Excel file to create a crowdfunding database. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

Create a Category DataFrame and a Subcategory DataFrame by extracting data from the Excel file and saving them as CSV files.

Create a Campaign DataFrame by extracting data from the Excel file and saving it as a CSV file.

Create a Contacts DataFrame by either using Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract data from the Excel file and save it as a CSV file.

Use the data from the CSV files to create a database schema for a Postgres database.

Import the CSV files into the Postgres database and verify that the data is correct.

That's it! Each step is broken down into more detail in the instructions above, so don't worry if you're not familiar with some of the terminology. Just take it one step at a time and you'll be on your way to creating a crowdfunding database in no time.
