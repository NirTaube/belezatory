Hey there!

This mini project involves working with data from an Excel file to create a crowdfunding database. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

Create a Category DataFrame and a Subcategory DataFrame by extracting data from the Excel file and saving them as CSV files.

Create a Campaign DataFrame by extracting data from the Excel file and saving it as a CSV file.

Create a Contacts DataFrame by either using Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract data from the Excel file and save it as a CSV file.

Use the data from the CSV files to create a database schema for a Postgres database.

Import the CSV files into the Postgres database and verify that the data is correct.


You can view the Code in the file: ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb
The supporting docs with SQL work can be found in resources.

Thanks !

BELEZA!
